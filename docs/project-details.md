### MARTA and Cobb County Public Transportation Communication Enhancement Project Documentation

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Public transportation is a critical component of urban life, providing a vital service for millions of residents and visitors. In Atlanta, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and the Cobb County Public Transportation System play significant roles in this ecosystem. However, both systems face challenges in effectively communicating service disruptions, closures, and delays to their users. This lack of timely and accessible information can lead to commuter frustration, inefficiencies, and a decrease in public trust in the transit systems.

### Solution Description
To address these challenges, our project aims to implement a robust and user-friendly text message alert system that will provide real-time updates on service disruptions, closures, and delays for both MARTA and the Cobb County Public Transportation System. By leveraging modern technologies and integrating multiple data sources, we will enhance communication and service accessibility for transit users across these regions.

#### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Users will receive instant notifications about any service changes, ensuring they are always informed and can plan their commutes accordingly.
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Our system will pull data from the MARTA API and Cobb County Routes/Scheduling to provide comprehensive coverage of transit services in the Atlanta area.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface will allow users to easily subscribe to and manage their alert preferences.
- **Scalability**: The architecture will be designed to handle a large number of users and expand to include additional transit systems or features in the future.

## Objectives
- **Harness Cutting-Edge AI**: Utilize state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) to build creative solutions addressing Atlanta's pressing issues.
- **Public Sector Collaboration**: Foster collaboration between engineers and public sector experts for impactful, practical solutions.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage the local tech community to support public welfare through technology.
- **Solution Implementation**: Develop practical prototypes that can be piloted and implemented by the city's departments.

## Technologies Used

### Front End
- **JavaScript**: The front end will be developed using JavaScript, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. Frameworks such as React or Vue.js may be used to streamline development and ensure maintainability.

### Back End
- **Rails**: The back end will be powered by Ruby on Rails, offering a robust and scalable platform to handle data processing, user management, and API integrations.

### Communication
- **Twilio**: Twilio's API will be utilized to send text message alerts to users. Twilio provides a reliable and easy-to-integrate solution for SMS communication.

### Data Sources
- **MARTA API**: To retrieve real-time data on service closures and delays from MARTA.
- **Cobb County Routes/Scheduling**: To incorporate additional transit information from Cobb County, ensuring a more comprehensive alert system.

### Preferred LLMs
- **LLM Details**: Preferred LLMs include GPT-4, GPT-3, LLaMA, Claude, etc. (Details to be confirmed and updated)
